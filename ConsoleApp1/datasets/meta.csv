Answers:
- Attended By - Name: Natasha 
- Type of Claim: Storm
- Confirm the Event Date with the insured: 2023-01-15
- Details Provided by the Occupant: We met on site with the Customer Natasha,  who has advised that recently during a large rain event in Mackay, water staining has occurred to the ceiling in the hallway, an area approximately 400 mm in diameter. Customer has engaged a roof plumber to attend who has sealed over the ridge joints as well as some missing rivets. Customer has also advised that the air conditioning cassette in the dining room ceiling has been leaking causing paint damage and mould directly surrounding it.

"<s>[INST] <<SYS>> Review the responses for the audit question, highlight any required responses (*) not provided, ignore others. Where a response is unsatisfactory provide comments about why the response isn't correct and provide details about how the response can be improved.. <</SYS>> Question: Question:  
Answers:
- : During our site assessment we observed very minor damages to the hallway ceiling lining which is consistent with a leaking roof. No storm created opening has occurred and water ingress was able to damage the ceiling due to poorly sealed ridge joints. This has been mitigated though as the customer has engaged their own roof plumber to attend to seal over the missing rivets and ridge joins.

The quoted works are required to bring the property back to pre-existing condition from the damage due to the storm, due to the property having pre-existing plastering defects and overlapping damages from a long-term leaking cassette air conditioning.  The claim will be recommended for cash settlement if policy determination accepts the claim.



We also observed a cassette style air conditioning installed to the Open Plan area which has some long-term damages surrounding the unit. Microbial growth is present indicating the damage has been occurring for an extended period of time due to the gradual process of liquid leaking. This should be considered as a secondary claim and will be recommended for decline due to the gradual process of liquid leaking/condensation.


- Is the damage consistent with the claimed event? Yes
- Internal Trades/ Repairs: Painting,Plastering
- Were there Contents involved in the Claim? : No

Answers:
- Are there any engineers reports required for this claim? No
- Conclusion: In our professional opinion the damages at the property are consistent with the storm event, however no storm created opening has occurred. Minor ceiling patching and painting is required to bring the property back to a pre-existing condition. We did note that there is a cassette style air conditioning in the living room which shows signs of long-term damage and should be considered as an escape of liquid. We recommend the damages from the storm claim as an accepts however, cash settlement is required due to the overlapping damages of the air-conditioner and pre-existing plaster defects throughout the property which are not related.

Where a response is unsatisfactory provide comments about why the response isn't correct and provide details about how the response can be improved.. <</SYS>> Question: Question:  
Answers:
- : In my professional opinion the damages to the properties are consistent with a rain event and high wind driven weather. However the condition of the frames have weakened sections and have significant water rot to the base of the jamb, this would indicate long term exposure to water. Additionally the aluminium door sill and tiled sill have been installed in a way that compromises required fall/drop to divert water away from door resulting in water pooling against door and frame ultimately weakening the frame and causing rot.


- Is the damage consistent with the claimed event? No
- External Trades/ Repairs: Carpentry
- Internal Trades/ Repairs: Painting,Plastering
- Details of owner maintenance required: Owners will be required to engage licensed contractors to replace/adjust current door sill to give sufficient fall and “lip” away from door.


- How soon does the owner maintenance need to be completed? Before the repairs can be started

The insured awoke at 6am to the sound of water dripping. The son-in-law came over and went onto the roof to inspect valley flashing.

Where a response is unsatisfactory provide comments about why the response isn't correct and provide details about how the response can be improved.. <</SYS>> Question: Question:  
Answers:
- : In my professional opinion the damages are not consistent with claimed event as no resultant damage is evident.

After reviewing the roof report it is stated that the water ingress was the result of defective workmanship not fixing the valley flashing to the valley boards. The valley flashing also had no signs of being riveted together so as to stop the flashings gradually slipping down over time resulting in the gap opening up allowing water to enter the ceiling cavity.

After reviewing restoration report, there is evidence of microbial growth within the bulk heads which indicates long term exposure to water.

As insured was unaware maintenance was required, the insurer representative has advised that claim can be accepted.


- Is the damage consistent with the claimed event? No
- External Trades/ Repairs: Metal Roofing
- Internal Trades/ Repairs: Drying and sanitisation
- Details of owner maintenance required: We recommend the insured engages a suitably qualified trade to remove roof sheets to expose the valley flashing, rivet together and fix properly to the valley boards. 

The remaining roof will need to be assessed and attend to protruding screw heads which will need to be removed and replaced.
- How soon does the owner maintenance need to be completed? Shall not prevent repair progress

Answers:
- : At time of inspection, I noted mould and deterioration on the kitchen ceiling along with the lounge room ceiling, but was not able to get enough information from the tenant.

We conducted a roofing report and it was identified that leaf and debris build up on and in roof tile laps and valleys.  This debris is actually blocking the valley flashings and won't allow water to flow, eventually backing up and entering the ceiling space. No weep holes in the ridge cap pointing, any water that blows under the ridge caps cannot escape through the weep holes to prevent water ingress.

The rear patio roof is the wrong profile roof sheet for such a low pitch.

It is recommended that all the leaf and debris be removed from the roof gutters, tiles and tile laps and weep holes installed to the ridge capping. Also, the patio roof sheeting should be changed to another profile suitable for the lower pitch.

Answers:
- Are there any engineers reports required for this claim? No
- Conclusion: After reviewing the roof report, owner maintenance is required. There was a large volume of leaf debris within the gutters and roof itself.

As the property is tenanted by young uni students it is my professional belief that regular maintenance has to be arranged by either the property manager or the owner of the dwelling .

It is recommended that all the leaf and debris be removed from the roof gutters, tiles and tile laps and weep holes installed to the ridge capping. Also, the patio roof sheeting should be changed to another profile suitable for the lower pitch.

Due to the house being tenanted, the property maintenance throughout, the dwelling was poor and inspection of the roof on arrival was covered in leaf debris and poor internal ceilings and walls was poor 

Due to no maintenance been carried out by the insured well information supplied by the property manager to the insured. The mould within the ceiling has been caused by a lack of poor maintenance within the dwelling within and on the tiled roof, hence the resultant damage to the internal linings.

Answers:
- Details: Met with the insured and assessor Isaac. Upon inspection of the roof i found to be in good condition for its age with no maintenance concerns observed. I used chalk to identify hail damage, i chalked multiple 1m2 locations of the roof and carport, i found no dents in these areas. I also couldn’t find any visual dents to the roofing or any flashings from hail. I found very minor dents to the whirly birds only. It’s my opinion the hail was too small to damage to corrugated sheeting and has only damaged the whirly birds as they are aluminium.



We had been asked off the insurer to complete a roof report for a third opinion as to if the roof was hail damaged or not. The roofer did not find any storm related damages to the roof.



23/10. Ambrose construct had been asked off assessor to complete another roof report to confirm if there is any hail damage or not, we completed another roof report and the trade returned to site twice for two opinions of the roof and again they found no hail damage to the sheeting or ridge caps.



UPDATE DUAL RE ATTENDANCE 16/1/24 



Ambrose Construct Group estimator has completed a dual re attendance with Suncorp assessor Dean and third party representative to complete a re inspection of the roof structure as the customer is disputing the outcome of the currently scope of works. Ambrose Construct Group estimator inspected the roof and advised the following 

Overview condition of the roof is good
We have re chalked approx 1m2 in multiple locations to all roof elevations end to end to identify only 2x sheeting affected by the event (as per the previous inspection) 
Minor hail impact present to the ridge capping (as per the previous inspection)
Hail impact to 2x whirlybirds  ( as per the previous inspection)
Third party has also inspected all areas and agreed with these findings 
Ambrose Construct Group advise that an liability quote has been provided for the damages sections of the roofing only, recommend cash settle due to partial roof repairs and a third party representative on the claim. Ambrose Construct Group recommend that the claim is to be referred back to the insurer for policy determination.

Answers:
- Details:   The home is good condition and has an acrylic shower base in the ensuite, which has a crack to the right hand side of the waist.

All grout and silicon are in good order. The shower screen is in good order.

The leak location report indicated that everything passed the test however the shower base crack will open up, allowing water in causing further damage.

The fiberglass shower tray feels as though it has never been installed correctly, it feels hollow underneath it. When stepping in the shower the tray sags which over time has weakened the fiberglass causing the crack.




To repair the shower tray a full ensuite renovation would be required to remove/replace the shower base.

There is no resultant damage as the insured occupant stopped using the shower in the ensuite, as soon as he noticed the crack in the shower base.

Answers:
- Are there any engineers reports required for this claim? No
- Conclusion:   The damage to the shower base is consistent with the claimed event. Where the crack is located in the shower base must have been just a weak point in the manufacture of the shower base, this is likely due to the incorrect installation of the shower base. It appears to have no bedding underneath the shower base, as it moves down when you press on it. 

Manufacturers recommend that the shower bases are bedded in on installation, other bases have feet underneath to give support to the shower base. This prevents the plastic bases cracking as they age.

Answers:
- Details: Upon inspection of the property it is evident the storm event has caused significant damage to the house. The roof structure has been blown off and house resulting in extensive damage to the structural integrity of the house.

The property is around 100 years old and with large amount wear and tear throughout, which is consistent with the age of the property. During our inspection at the property in 2020, it is noted that there stumps around the property did have an evident lean on them and the roof sheeting was also lifting in different locations.

The roof structure and wall framing is made up of hardwood timber which is in average condition. There is no evidence of tie down to the roof structure or wall framing which has contributed to the event, although when the house was built this was not a requirement.




Pre existing damages have been noted to the stumps and subfloor structure throughout the house, as highlighted in the images.






- Is the damage consistent with the claimed event? Yes

Answers:

- Conclusion: In our professional opinion, the damage is consistent with house movement due to wind forces, however we note that the conditions on the claimed date of loss were noted by the bureau of meteorology to be 41km/h recorded at the closest weather station.

The Beaufort scale of wind force indicates that this is considered a 'Fresh Gale' and likely effects are 'twigs break from trees' and 'walking against the wind is very difficult'. Due to the condition/age of the property, it has not been able to withstand the wind gusts which resulted in extensive damage to the roof structure, external wall framing. The house subfloor and stumps were in poor condition prior to the event, and this has contributed to the movement of the house and its structural integrity. 




It is our opinion that if the house was well maintained and in good condition, the damages would not have occurred, despite the conditions on the date of loss.




Due to the extent of damages, it has been deemed that no repair works could be warranted to the house, and a full rebuild of the house would be required. 

We also note that the rebuilding cost exceeds the sum insured.




In this instance, we refer this claim back to the Insurer for consideration and policy determination, and will await further instruction.

- Conclusion: It is clear that the the skylight has had silicone repairs carried out previously. The previous repairs had deteriorated, which allowed rain water to enter. We advised the insured to have a dry pan flashing installed to reduce the risk of further leaks in the ceiling. The ceiling plaster has a high moisture reading, which may promote mould growth in the future. The insured had advised that he siliconed the skylight a few years ago because it was leaking, the silicone seal at the time stopped the leaking. Replace the skylight and flashings

MAIN ROOF 

Hail damage occurred to the roof where dents are evident throughout the roof cover, including roof sheeting, flashings and cappings. The roof requires complete replacement.

Hell damage occurred to the solar panels where some panels are smashed and require full replacement, please see the specialist report attached. 

SHED

Hail damage occurred to the Shed where denting is evident to the roof, requiring complete replacement of the Shed.



CAUSE OF DAMAGE



Resultant damage is consistent with hailstones impacting the roof on the reported date of loss. Hail dents are evident on all elevations of the roof. Hail dents are more visible in some areas depending on the direction of the sunlight reflecting over the roof.

The insured Tom and Lone advised that a cyclonic type conditions hit their house on Friday evening. There was heavy rain at the time the highwinds hit. The winds blow the gas BBQ off the decking and doors of the cupboard. The heavy rains flooded into the eaves sheets which caused bubbling to the eave sheet paints. The insured also advised that the highwinds stretched the front shade sail, causing the sail to sage which it did not do before the event.

- Details: Upon visual inspection of the damages and the property occupant statement it is evident that the heavy rain and strong winds caused the rain water to flood back into the eave sheets. The water has soaked through the asbestos lining eave sheets and caused the paint to bubble. As the eave sheets are asbestos the sheets will need to be removed and replaced with hardiflex FC sheeting.

The front shade sail appears to be sagging, The insured advised the shade sail did not sage before the high winds stretched the fabric and possibly the stainless steel perimeter wire. The shade sail cannot be tighten any more as the turn buckles are already adjusted in fully.

Answers:

- Conclusion: The insured described the Highwinds as cyclonic. The wings were strong enough to blow the barbecue away from its position, also blow the doors off the cupboard under the eave on the rear decking. The rain was heavy enough to cause the water to ingress into the eaves sheeting causing the water to seep through the eave sheets and the paint to bubble. The insured has informed me that the eave sheets are asbestos, which will be required to be removed and replaced to bring back top pre-existing condition.

The front shade sail appears to move excessively in the wind due to the shade sail being stretched. The turn buckles cannot be adjusted any more to remove the slack. The shade sail has been stretched from the strong winds. The shade sail requires remaking to bring the shade sail back to pre-existing condition.  Due to the size and minimal fixing points the of the shade sail, the shade sail may stretch again, therefore a Liability quote is supplied.

RESULTANT DAMAGE

Our inspection investigated resultant storm damage claim to:

ROOF

RESULTANT DAMAGE 

Damage has occurred to the concrete roof tiles, where tiles have been dislodged and broken, with a section of approximately 4m2 requiring replacement. 

Damage has also occurred to the parapet wall capping which is bent and requires replacement.  

We note that the affected electrical POC had been reinstated by the service provider, and a make safe undertaken by the SES to mitigate further damages. 

Please note further damages may be identified during the repair process, if so a variation would be applied.

CAUSE OF DAMAGE

We investigated the cause of the storm wind damage and observed:

ROOF

The damage was caused by high winds during the event, which caused a nearby tree to fall, impacting the electrical POC cable and metal wall capping.

We can confirm that on Friday the 15/12/23 fast-moving storms brought strong winds, wind driven heavy rain and large Hail to south-east Queensland.

The Bureau of Meteorology recorded a wind gust of 169kph at Archerfield Airport in southern Brisbane at 4:31pm

The bureau described the storm as ""very dangerous"" With 19,000 properties losing power.

- Details: Ambrose Construct have carried out a building assessment at premises on 16/01/2024 at approximately 7:00AM ;in the presence of the property contact Penny Johnson. We report that the insured property is an approx 400m2 home of concrete block construction with a colourbond roof covering. The property is approximately 40 years old and has been maintained in good condition. The insured premises consists of two separate dwellings which has been separated in our scope to reflect the main house and the shed house. 

The flood water height reached 1.8m within the insured properties and we have allowed for a full height strip out in our scope of works. The floor tiles were inspected and found to be drummy throughout the dwellings.

 During our assessment, we identified numerous areas of concern regarding building compliance and pre-existing damages. Termite damage was identified to the main house along with non-compliant wet areas to both main house and shed house. 

The shed house does not appear to have been built with council approval and does not comply with current building codes. The wet areas are non-compliant with the AS3740. Excessive building movement and settlement cracks have been identified throughout the property. 



The insured also mentioned that they would like to make structural revisions to their property which would fall outside the insured scope of works. Due to this request, they may seek cash settlement for the repairs. 


- Is the damage consistent with the claimed event? No
- Outline defects: Excessive building settlement cracks identified throughout the property and wet areas do not comply with AS3740 standards.
