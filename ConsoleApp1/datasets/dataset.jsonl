Customer has engaged a roof plumber to attend who has sealed over the ridge joints as well as some missing rivets.

{"Input":"Question: Builders Observations accurately recordedAnswers:\r\n: During our site assessment we observed very minor damages to the hallway ceiling lining which is consistent with a leaking roof. No storm created opening has occurred and water ingress was able to damage the ceiling due to poorly sealed ridge joints. This has been mitigated though as the customer has engaged their own roof plumber to attend to seal over the missing rivets and ridge joins.\n\nThe quoted works are required to bring the property back to pre-existing condition from the damage due to the storm, due to the property having pre-existing plastering defects and overlapping damages from a long-term leaking cassette air conditioning.  The claim will be recommended for cash settlement if policy determination accepts the claim.\n\n\n\nWe also observed a cassette style air conditioning installed to the Open Plan area which has some long-term damages surrounding the unit. Microbial growth is present indicating the damage has been occurring for an extended period of time due to the gradual process of liquid leaking. This should be considered as a secondary claim and will be recommended for decline due to the gradual process of liquid leaking/condensation.\n\n\r\nIs the damage consistent with the claimed event?: Yes\r\nInternal Trades/ Repairs: Painting,Plastering\r\nWere there Contents involved in the Claim? : No\r\n","Output":"Agent:Primary Causation accurately recorded | Score:1\r\n","Instruction":"Review the responses for the audit question, highlight any required responses (*) not provided, ignore others.

{"Input":"Question: Builders Conclusion - clear, concise, correct policy response, correct referral determinationAnswers:\r\nAre there any engineers reports required for this claim?: No\r\nConclusion: In our professional opinion the damages at the property are consistent with the storm event, however no storm created opening has occurred. Minor ceiling patching and painting is required to bring the property back to a pre-existing condition. We did note that there is a cassette style air conditioning in the living room which shows signs of long-term damage and should be considered as an escape of liquid.

It appears to have no bedding underneath the shower base, as it moves down when you press on it. \n\nManufacturers recommend that the shower bases are bedded in on installation, other bases have feet underneath to give support to the shower base.

{"Input":"Question: Builders Conclusion - clear, concise, correct policy response, correct referral determinationAnswers:\r\nAre there any engineers reports required for this claim?: Yes\r\nConclusion: In our professional opinion, the damage is consistent with house movement due to wind forces, however we note that the conditions on the claimed date of loss were noted by the bureau of meteorology to be 41km/h recorded at the closest weather station.\n\nThe Beaufort scale of wind force indicates that this is considered a \u0027Fresh Gale\u0027 and likely effects are \u0027twigs break from trees\u0027 and \u0027walking against the wind is very difficult\u0027. Due to the condition/age of the property, it has not been able to withstand the wind gusts which resulted in extensive damage to the roof structure, external wall framing. The house subfloor and stumps were in poor condition prior to the event, and this has contributed to the movement of the house and its structural integrity. \n\n\n\n\nIt is our opinion that if the house was well maintained and in good condition, the damages would not have occurred, despite the conditions on the date of loss.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the extent of damages, it has been deemed that no repair works could be warranted to the house, and a full rebuild of the house would be required. \n\nWe also note that the rebuilding cost exceeds the sum insured.\n\n\n\n\nIn this instance, we refer this claim back to the Insurer for consideration and policy determination, and will await further instruction.\r\nRepair Cost: Quote\r\nRepairs Proceeding within Authorisation Limits: No - Policy Determination Required\r\n","Output":"Agent:Report Details - Asbestos, Owner Maintenance and Defects, Accomodation - accurately filled out | Score:0\r\n","Instruction":"Review the responses for the audit question, highlight any required responses (*) not provided, ignore others.

{"Input":"Question: Builders Conclusion - clear, concise, correct policy response, correct referral determinationAnswers:\r\nAre there any engineers reports required for this claim?: No\r\nConclusion: The insured described the Highwinds as cyclonic. The wings were strong enough to blow the barbecue away from its position, also blow the doors off the cupboard under the eave on the rear decking. The rain was heavy enough to cause the water to ingress into the eaves sheeting causing the water to seep through the eave sheets and the paint to bubble.

The turn buckles cannot be adjusted any more to remove the slack. The shade sail has been stretched from the strong winds.
