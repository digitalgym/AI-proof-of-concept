330,Details Provided by the Occupant,"We met on site with the Customer Natasha,  who has advised that recently during a large rain event in Mackay, water staining has occurred to the ceiling in the hallway, an area approximately 400 mm in diameter. Customer has engaged a roof plumber to attend who has sealed over the ridge joints as well as some missing rivets. Customer has also advised that the air conditioning cassette in the dining room ceiling has been leaking causing paint damage and mould directly surrounding it.",Complete,Suncorp,8
350,,"During our site assessment we observed very minor damages to the hallway ceiling lining which is consistent with a leaking roof. No storm created opening has occurred and water ingress was able to damage the ceiling due to poorly sealed ridge joints. This has been mitigated though as the customer has engaged their own roof plumber to attend to seal over the missing rivets and ridge joins.  The quoted works are required to bring the property back to pre-existing condition from the damage due to the storm, due to the property having pre-existing plastering defects and overlapping damages from a long-term leaking cassette air conditioning.  The claim will be recommended for cash settlement if policy determination accepts the claim.    We also observed a cassette style air conditioning installed to the Open Plan area which has some long-term damages surrounding the unit. Microbial growth is present indicating the damage has been occurring for an extended period of time due to the gradual process of liquid leaking. This should be considered as a secondary claim and will be recommended for decline due to the gradual process of liquid leaking/condensation.  ",Complete,Suncorp,9

356,Are there any engineers reports required for this claim?,No,Complete,Suncorp,11
370,Is the damage consistent with the claimed event?,Yes,Complete,Suncorp,9
380,Conclusion,"In our professional opinion the damages at the property are consistent with the storm event, however no storm created opening has occurred. Minor ceiling patching and painting is required to bring the property back to a pre-existing condition. We did note that there is a cassette style air conditioning in the living room which shows signs of long-term damage and should be considered as an escape of liquid. We recommend the damages from the storm claim as an accepts however, cash settlement is required due to the overlapping damages of the air-conditioner and pre-existing plaster defects throughout the property which are not related.
